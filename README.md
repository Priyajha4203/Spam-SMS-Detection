# Spam-SMS-Detection

This project tackles the growing issue of spam text messages. We'll build a machine learning model to classify incoming SMS messages as either spam or ham. The model will utilize the multinomial naive bayes algorithm, which analyzes the frequency of words in a message to predict its spam likelihood.
The project will involve:

i)Data Acquisition: Obtain a dataset containing labeled SMS messages, where each message is categorized as spam or ham.

ii)Data Preprocessing: The text data will be cleaned by removing unnecessary characters and converting everything to lowercase for consistency.

iii)Feature Engineering: Convert the SMS messages into numerical features suitable for the algorithm. This might involve techniques like counting the occurrences of specific words.

iv)Model Training & Evaluation: The multinomial naive bayes model will be trained on a portion of the data and then evaluate its performance on unseen messages to assess its accuracy in spam detection.
